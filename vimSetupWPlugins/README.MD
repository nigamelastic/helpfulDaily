#VIM-PLUG/VIMRC

My setup for vim - Plug, to manage plugins and the vimrc file. 
PS: you can run any shell script directly from vim by pressing "Esc" and typing `:!` followed by your shell command. 
For example, in order to run `ls` simple Press "Esc" and type `:!ls`

## Installation
`./VIMInstall.sh`

## Usage
Open Vim and press "Esc" follwed by `:PlugInstall` , for the first time after running the installation script.  
Use away the enhanced vim experience. 

PS : Removing all plugins after deleting from vimrc `PlugClean` , Upgrade all plugins `PlugUpgrade`
Plugin help via `help <PluginName>`, example `:help NERDTree`
